# About

🌏 Originally from South Africa, I have lived in London and currently call Germany home. 🦁

💻 I have over 23 years of experience designing and developing enterprise systems, and I am passionate about software development. 📚

🎽 In my free time, I enjoy participating in endurance sports, including multiple ironman distance triathlons and ultra marathons. 🏃‍♂️

✈️ I have experience as a flight instructor and skydive pilot, which has given me a unique perspective on aviation. 👨‍✈️
